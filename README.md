# tourbrush

This R package currently consists of one function `tourbrush()`, which accepts a data frame as input, and creates a shiny app for visualizing high-dimensional data. It is very much inspired by [xgobi/ggobi](http://www.ggobi.org/).


## Installing 

```r
devtools::install_github("cpsievert/tourbrush")
